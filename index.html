    <h1>Dear Human</h1>
    <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>

    <p><strong>Dear Human began with a simple truth:</strong><br>
    Everywhere we turn, we’re told we’re not enough.</p>

    <p>Ads whisper that we need to be richer, prettier, thinner.<br>
    Social media compares our worst days to someone else’s highlight reel.<br>
    Even the constant pings on our phone seem to say, <em>“You’re falling behind.”</em></p>

    <p>We’re constantly made to feel like we’re doing something wrong.<br>
    And the quiet result?<br>
    Most people feel undervalued. Unappreciated. Unseen.</p>

    <p><strong>We want to change that.</strong></p>

    <p>Dear Human was born from a desire to make people feel seen, heard, and deeply valued.<br>
    To remind them that they matter—exactly as they are.<br>
    That their quiet efforts, their heavy days, their kind hearts haven’t gone unnoticed.</p>

    <p>This isn’t just about kindness.<br>
    It’s about showing up in the moments people feel most invisible.</p>

    <p>We’re here to tell the real stories.<br>
    The unpolished ones. The beautiful, messy human ones.<br>
    Because when we see ourselves in someone else’s truth,<br>
    we realize we were never alone to begin with.</p>

    <p><strong>Dear Human exists to deliver unexpected moments of emotional recognition—right when you need it most.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>You are not alone.<br>
    You are not invisible.<br>
    You are enough.</strong></p>

    <h2>Welcome to Dear Human.</h2>
